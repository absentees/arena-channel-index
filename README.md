# are.na channel list extension for firefox

I use are.na a lot of the time as a inspiration/reference/bookmarking tool. Often my workflow is Go to are.na > Search for channel called "shop" for example > Scroll through saved blocks.

This is a few steps that would be easier to navigate around with a persistent index in the browser. I imagine this could also work nicely as a toolbar app on Mac OS.
